## 2D Bullet Hell Game Jam 

### Goal
Produce a 2d Bullet Hell game using the theme *Consequences* by 05/19/24 (I wanna get mine done before the 17th to work on another game jam that weekend)

### Details

I want to build a game using `Rust`. I have never coded in rust and have always been interested, and I have never participated in a game jam before.

I figure it could be a fun way to just get something done!


### Addressing the theme
I had a great convo with a friend about this theme and we came to some great conclusions. Using the dictionary definition of a consequnce is essentially the outcome of a choice. So how else can we provide the player with consequence than by providing them with choices. 

### Game play goals

- Functions for bullet paths (maybe even enemy paths)
- Fun space art style, with space ships, and plasma balls (make some startrek models lmao)
- Provide choices to the player that lead to gameplay changes
