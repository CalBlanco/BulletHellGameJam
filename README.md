# 2D Bullet Hell Game Jam 

## Goal
Produce a 2d Bullet Hell game using the theme *Consequences* by 05/19/24 (I wanna get mine done before the 17th to work on another game jam that weekend)

## Details

I want to build a game using `Rust`. I have never coded in rust and have always been interested, and I have never participated in a game jam before.

I figure it could be a fun way to just get something done!


## Consequences
Consequences come in many shapes and sizes. Not all consequences are bad. 

- If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen you will consequentially see two more enemies spawn at the top of the screen (as well as the one who made it to the bottom going back to try again).
- If you fail to clear a wave before the next wave spawns in. Consequentially you will not recieve a power up after that wave
- Power ups spawn in groups of three, only one can be selected impacting either your bullets, shapes, or health.
- Time errodes all things, and consequentially will make the game much much harder as it goes on (waves will get closer together, and more units will spawn per wave)
