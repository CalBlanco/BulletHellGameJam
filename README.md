## 2D Bullet Hell Game Jam 

### Goal
Produce a 2d Bullet Hell game using the theme *Consequences* by 05/19/24 (I wanna get mine done before the 17th to work on another game jam that weekend)

### Details

I want to build a game using `Rust`. I have never coded in rust and have always been interested, and I have never participated in a game jam before.

I figure it could be a fun way to just get something done!
